The program - GEO POINTS DATABASE - changes the [MlengelaPD8](https://github.com/CIS1250Python/MlengelaPD8/blob/main/MlengelaDP8.zip) so that instead of reading in a list of five or more points from a file, the project will read the points in from a dababase.
Here's what the program does: 
1. The created program creates a database and insert at least five points. The following are the points to be used:
    * 35.0714,106.6289, Main Campus
    * 35.0998,104.0639, Montoya
    * 35.2328,106.6630, Rio Rancho
    * 35.0856,106.6493, STEMULUS Center
    * 35.1836,106.5939, ATC
2. Run the database to initialize code to create the database.
3. Modify GUI program from [MlengelaPD10](https://github.com/CIS1250Python/MlengelaPD10/blob/main/MlengelaDP10.zip) so that it reads points from my database instead of a file.
